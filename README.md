# Eurovision Song Contest Points Visualization ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ¶

Welcome to the Eurovision Song Contest Points Visualization project! This repository visualizes the points awarded to contestants in the Eurovision Song Contest over various years using a bar chart race. The data has been cleaned and visualized using Flourish.


## Project Overview
The Eurovision Song Contest is an annual international song competition, held primarily among the member countries of the European Broadcasting Union. Since its inception in 1956, the contest has grown into one of the longest-running and most-watched non-sporting events in the world. Each participating country submits an original song to be performed on live television and radio, then casts votes for the other countries' songs to determine the most popular song in the competition.

This project aims to visualize the historical scores of Eurovision contestants from various countries using a dynamic and engaging bar chart race. The data spans several years and highlights the competitive nature and changing trends in the contest over time. The visualization is created using Flourish, a powerful tool for creating interactive data visualizations.

## Data Sources ðŸ“Š
The data for this project has been sourced from various Eurovision Song Contest archives and includes:
- Country names
- Points awarded to each country in each year

## Data Cleaning ðŸ§¹
To ensure the data is suitable for visualization, several cleaning steps were performed:
- Removing duplicate entries
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing country names for consistency

## Visualization ðŸ“ˆ
The cleaned data has been uploaded to Flourish, where it is visualized as a bar chart race. In this visualization, each bar represents a country's accumulated points in the Eurovision Song Contest for a given year. The bar chart race format dynamically shows changes in rankings and scores over time, providing a visually compelling narrative of the contest's history.
